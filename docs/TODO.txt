To do list:
- make a runList() class which keeps track of all the required analyses and their required analyses, etc., ensuring no repetition.
- conform strategyAnalysis() to the required analyses/runList() setup.
- if equity ratio is negative the CAGR is complex and math.pow() will return an exception. 
- how should I treat negative equity? Adjust to zero and accumulate debts?
- monthly returns histogram
- add input from correlated indices to GradConf (possible for other strategies?)
- modify GradConf to use non-Gaussian errors, e.g. Breit-Wigner gamma found with RooFit.
- implement multi-index strategies with position sizing.
- implement Turtles' System 1
- strategy parameter optimisation class - require input parameters as a dictionary?

- web app
- median and MAD
